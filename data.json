Although the new algorithm is more restrictive than the older version, this is much faster (more than x50 in some cases) and generally more reliable and probably covers most of the realistic wall connections. Some of the restrictions of this algorithm include:  *Works only on lines or polylines. (Curves can be input, but they will be converted to polylines.) *Works only on curves that are planar and parallel to XY plane. *Can\u0027t solve wall connections from a wall end to a wall body which are too close to a wall end. *If a segment at end disappeares during wall intersection, that intersection can\u0027t be solved. *Intersections between curve bodies (intersections where the intersection point on both of the curves are not at their ends) are also not solved.\nTutorials: https://www.youtube.com/@ofkurtarch5777","keywords":"architecture, building, design, modelling, railing, roof, stair, wall","prerelease":false,"homepageUrl":"https://www.food4rhino.com/en/app/arqishap3d","filters":59,"owners":[{"id":426,"name":"\u00D6mer Faruk Kurt"}]},{"id":"array4d","version":"1.1.8","updated":"2026-01-06T14:09:28+00:00","authors":"Abdullah Mallah","downloads":317,"iconUrl":"https://yak.rhino3d.com/versions/array4d/1.1.8/_icon","description":"Array4D \u2014 Rule-Based Experimental Assembly Tool for Rhino - Array4D is a Rhinocommon command for generating controlled spatial variations from a single three-dimensional fragment. \nRather than producing neutral copies, the script operates as a rule-based array system, allowing fragments to be repeated, rotated, and scaled across multiple directions while preserving legibility of solid\u2013void relationships, part\u2013whole hierarchies, and micro\u2013macro spatial effects. \nThe tool is designed for experimental assemblies in architectural design studios, where repetition is not a matter of efficiency but a means of spatial inquiry.

The command checks and warns if there is no continuity between the curves or to an edge of the trimmed object. It also allow you to extend the curves on the trimmed surface.\nChainSplit works similarly, the only difference is that all parts of the splitted object remain.\nTo use ChainTools commands, simply type \u0022ChainTrim\u0022 or \u0022ChainSplit\u0022 in the command line.

Needs .NET Framework 4.8 Runtime installed from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet-framework/net48. The main functionality is in two grasshopper components. The first component \u0022fills\u0022 a closed curve with a soap film, the second component \u0022fills\u0022 a surface in between two closed surfaces, giving a topologically cylindrical surface. Often, on the first try the result has self-intersections, but this can often be repaired by adjusting the rotation angle and the flipping boolean - these are additional parameters of the components. The algorithm is fast: there is neither recursion nor solution of a linear-algebraic problem on a mesh. Instead, the algorithm solves three Laplacian equations on the the unit-disk - one for each of x, y, z - and then transfers these solutions into 3d space. If the resulting parametrized surface happened to be conformal, the result would be the correct minimal surface. Otherwise, it is an approximation.","keywords":"analytic-solutions, boundary-value-problem, closed_curve, curves, dirichlet-boundaries, geometry, interpolation, minimal-surfaces, modelling, partial-differential-equations, surface_meshes, tween","prerelease":false,"homepageUrl":"https://github.com/Mathias-Fuchs/MinimalSurface","filters":45,"owners":[{"id":181,"name":"Dr. Mathias Fuchs"}]},{"id":"MiscToolbox","version":"0.0.14","updated":"2021-09-27T09:37:45+00:00","authors":"Stamatios Psarras","downloads":180,"iconUrl":"https://yak.rhino3d.com/versions/MiscToolbox/0.0.14/_icon","description":"A series of utility tools to be used with Grasshopper","keywords":"utilities","prerelease":false,"homepageUrl":"https://github.com/psarras/GH-Misc-Toolbox/","filters":27,"owners":[{"id":320,"name":"Stamatios Psarras"}]},{"id":"mNY","version":"0.250702.10","updated":"2025-07-02T16:12:36+00:00","authors":"YD Song","downloads":19,"iconUrl":"https://yak.rhino3d.com/versions/mNY/0.250702.10/_icon","description":"mNY description","keywords":"","prerelease":false,"homepageUrl":null,"filters":115,"owners":[{"id":5702,"name":"Yeong Song"}]},{"id":"ModeloPlugin","version":"1.0.0","updated":"2023-05-24T06:06:47+00:00","authors":"shanpai","downloads":105,"iconUrl":"/icons/special/default.png","description":"ModeloPlugin","keywords":"","prerelease":false,"homepageUrl":"https://www.modaiyun.com","filters":39,"owners":[{"id":648,"name":"\u9EC4\u6B66"}]},{"id":"Modelur4Rhino","version":"2023.3.4","updated":"2023-03-03T22:41:01+00:00","authors":"AgiliCity d.o.o.","downloads":1815,"iconUrl":"https://yak.rhino3d.com/versions/Modelur4Rhino/2023.3.4/_icon","description":"Modelur is a parametric urban design plugin for Rhino, implemented in C#.

It integrates multiple basic functions in Rhino and has undergone secondary development. This plugin allows users to map any curve texture designed on a plane onto the surfaces of complex 3D models, while minimizing or eliminating deformation of the texture curves on the 3D surfaces. With ShapeMap, designing textures on 3D model surfaces becomes much easier, and the operation process is intuitive and simple.\nSpecial emphasis, ShapeMap supports mapping texture curves onto polysurfaces (Brep) without being affected or constrained by the surface\u0027s UV direction. It enables the placement of complete, unified, and uniform texture curves across multiple connected surfaces. This resolves the long-standing limitation of traditional methods, which could not effectively apply textures across multiple surfaces.\nShapeMap is currently widely used in industries such as automotive design, product design, footwear design, and architectural design.\nThe sample file can be downloaded here: https://www.food4rhino.com/en/app/shapemap\nVersion 1.1.1 Release Notes: Bugs fixed.","keywords":"","prerelease":false,"homepageUrl":"https://www.food4rhino.com/en/app/shapemap","filters":73,"owners":[{"id":2006,"name":"Jorin Chi"}]},{"id":"Sheepdog","version":"1.0.0","updated":"2025-10-08T21:23:47+00:00","authors":"Mule Studio, Pablo Dur\u00E1n Mill\u00E1n","downloads":422,"iconUrl":"https://yak.rhino3d.com/versions/Sheepdog/1.0.0/_icon","description":"Sheepdog adds Fences to help keep your canvas more organized.\nBy Mule Studio. \nLead Developer: Pablo Dur\u00E1n Mill\u00E1n","keywords":"box, canvas, dog, duran, fence, group, harri, jack, lewis, mule, munro, organisation, organise, organization, pablo, rectangle, sheep","prerelease":false,"homepageUrl":"hello@mule.studio","filters":43,"owners":[{"id":4844,"name":"Harri Lewis"}]},{"id":"SheepMetal","version":"0.9.0","updated":"2026-02-12T17:19:30+00:00","authors":"Felix Brunold,VektorNode","downloads":9158,"iconUrl":"https://yak.rhino3d.com/versions/SheepMetal/0.9.0/_icon","description":"SheepMetal is a Grasshopper plugin for designing and preparing sheet metal parts.

Includes a tet mesh previewer, and example tet mesh, a cube tet mesh provide, and an isosurface solver. This is a companion plugin to TRmesh for tetrahedral meshing, but TRfem includes a number of tet meshing components that will usually suffice for real-world tasks.\nThe main solver component takes the following inputs:\n  - A Rhino quad mesh with each quad representing a tetrahedron.\n  - A list of tetrahedral references. At index j, it indicates the material that tetrahedron j belongs to. These are indices into the next parameter, the conductivities. If unsure, just provide {0} here and {1.0} for the conductivities.\n  - A list of conductivities. At index i, it contains the conductivity of material i,in Watt per meter and Kelvin. Typical value is 0.02 for insulation foam, and 2 for concrete. Length of the list is the number of different materials your tetrahedral mesh consists of. If unsure, just provide {1.0}, standing for one material of conductivity 1.0. If there is only one material, the value has no influence on the result, as expected.\n  - A list of vertex indices that are hot, for instance exposed to interior heated air. These are the heat sources.\n  - A list of vertex indices that are cold, for instance exposed to exterior cold air. These are the heat sinks. The resulting temperature field will have a gradient that goes from the cold to the hot vertices.\nNote that all other vertices are supposed to be exposed to a good insulator, for instance air that is not convective, such as air between walls. The resulting temperature field will have a gradient perpendicular to those boundary vertices, corresponding to absence of heat transfer in and out of these boundary patches. This is in accordance with the definition of a thermal bridge: \u0022A structural component with much higher conductivity than the surrounding components\u0022. We therefore model the surrounding components as not receiving or emitting heat transfer at all.\nThe algorithm and implementation was reviewed and published in https://doi.org/10.3390/encyclopedia2020067.

Often the problem is that the resulting curves overlap. Tweener solves that problem. This Grasshopper/Rhino plugin generates curves that interpolate between:\n \n  - either any number of closed planar curves, one of which is the outer one and emcompasses all others (This part of Tweener is called the \u0022planar Tweener\u0022 even though there are also functions for extruding the curves to 3D), or between:\n\n  - two arbitrary, not necessarily closed input curves, on any constraint surface given by an input surface brep or surface mesh.\n   \nSee \u0022mathiasfuchs.com/TweenerExamples\u0022 for official examples, and \u0022mathiasfuchs.com/tweenerhelp.html\u0022 for the command reference. The resulting output curves are guaranteed not to cross each other or the input curves, no matter how complex your input is. Moreover, they are guaranteed to be smooth and parametrization-independent. The output is either the curves, or a mesh textured according to the tween gradient. Tweener curves are manipulated by their input curves, just the way usual curves are manipulated by their control points. Thus, Tweener can be thought of as introducing another modeling paradigm for curves.\nBoth the in-built Rhino and Grasshopper tweeners as well as a certain popular Grasshopper plugin don\u0027t leave the control-point paradigm for generating tween curves. As a result, the tween curves start to overlap quickly, as soon as the input becomes somewhat complex. In contrast, this package provides a tweening functionality whose emphasis on the mere curves\u0027 shapes is entirely independent on how the curve is controlled or parametrized. Since the tween curves don\u0027t cut each other or the input curves, Tweener lends itself specifically to applications such as general illustration, typography, 3d printing, layer design, CNC, landscape architecture etc - typically in landscapes, you don\u0027t want overhanging cliffs; likewise, a concrete printer usually has difficulties with excessive overhangs. There is a TweenerTopo component that allows to extrude planar tween curves to 3D in order to generate quality landscape isolines, allowing the user to provide an additional \u0022shape\u0022 parameter that controls the convexity/concavity of the landscape.\nApart from landscape design, the planar Tweener lends itself for interior design where smooth guard curves steer people along the design language of your given interior - think Ikea, or think of the space between facade and core of a high-rise building.\nTweener is not limited to planar curves or simple extrusions of planar curves: it can tween between any two arbitrary, not necessarily closed curves, if there is a constraint surface as additional input. Tweener pulls the input curves back to the constraint surface and then generates curves between them, on the surface. Again, overlaps are guaranteed not to occur.\nMoreover, there is a powerful interactive TweenCurve editing environment that can be reached from the Rhino command line, including a \u0022Fish Eye effect\u0022, and a way to drag the curves without disrupting the aesthetic and visual quality! Please watch the \u0022monkey face\u0022 video on food4rhino to see what it does, and type \u0022TweenStartExample\u0022 command to start an example editing environment.\nThis is an evaluation version, valid for some time. After your preview period expires, you can either prolong it, or purchase a Pro Tweener which offers: API access, output to NURBS curve, ability to be called from within scripts, and a high quality remeshing option.\nTweener is part of a series of geometrical finite element applications, aiming at enabling both tech-savvy and novice users to quickly prototype, and web-deploy parametric finite element applications to general geometric problems. Further examples of such applications include heat transfer, image registration, medial axis extraction, Poisson interpolation, and optimal transfer type problems, see \u0022https://mathiasfuchs.com/Tweeners\u0022 for more info and examples.\nBy installing Tweener, you accept the privacy terms in \u0022mathiasfuchs.com/TweenerPrivacy.html\u0022. This version is for Rhino 8.0.23304.9001 and above on Windows 10 or 11.

It features a robust material management system with built-in libraries and custom import/export capabilities, precise U-value calculations that account for thermal bridges and generate EnergyPlus-ready outputs, and dynamic thermal analysis compliant with ISO 13786. Users can visualize temperature gradients and heat flux to identify weak points, and perform 2D condensation risk assessments to detect potential moisture issues. In addition, the Rhino plugin supports full 3D steady-state heat transfer analysis: users model solids directly in Rhino, assign materials to layers, compute U-values, and rigorously analyze complex thermal bridges within detailed geometric assemblies.","keywords":"","prerelease":false,"homepageUrl":"https://koalaflx.com","filters":71,"owners":[{"id":192,"name":"T  Dogan"}]}]
